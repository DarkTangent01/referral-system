# Express.js Application with Security, Logging, Caching, and MongoDB

This is a robust Express.js application designed to provide a RESTful API with user management features. The application is built with a strong focus on security, performance, and maintainability, integrating key middleware for data protection, rate limiting, and caching.

## Features

- **Security**
  - Secure HTTP headers with `helmet`.
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse with `express-rate-limit`.
  - Protection against NoSQL injection using `express-mongo-sanitize`.
  - Defense against XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attacks with `xss-clean`.
  - (Optional) CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection with `csurf`.

- **Performance**
  - Efficient API response caching with `apicache`.

- **Logging**
  - Comprehensive HTTP request logging with `morgan`.

- **Database**
  - MongoDB for data persistence, fully integrated with Mongoose.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance (local or remote).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager for handling dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
``` 
## Installation

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
PORT=your-port-number
```

Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your actual MongoDB connection string and your-port-number with the desired port for the server.

## Usage
## Starting the Server
```
To start the server, run: yarn start
```


The server will run on the port specified in your `.env` file, or default to port 6000 if not specified.

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/users: Retrieve all users. (Response cached for 5 minutes)
- POST /api/users: Create a new user.
- Example API Call
- Using curl to fetch all users: `curl -X GET http://localhost:6000/api/users`

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used in the application:

 - `MONGODB_URI: MongoDB connection string.`
 - `PORT: Port on which the server will run.`

## Middleware Overview
- **body-parser**: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers.
- **cookie-parser**: Parses cookies and populates req.cookies.
- **helmet**: Secures HTTP headers to protect against well-known web vulnerabilities.
- **express-rate-limit**: Limits repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints.
- **express-mongo-sanitize**: Prevents MongoDB Operator Injection by sanitizing user-supplied data.
- **xss-clean**: Sanitizes user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
- **morgan**: Logs HTTP requests and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **apicache**: Provides middleware to cache API responses for enhanced performance.

## Logs
HTTP request logs are stored in `logs/access.log`. The logs are rotated automatically, ensuring that old logs are archived properly. The log format can be customized in the morgan setup within the code.


## Error Handling
The application includes custom error handling middleware for:
- **CSRF Token Errors**: Returns a 403 status code with a message when an invalid CSRF token is detected.
- **General Errors**: Logs errors and returns a 500 status code with a generic error message.

## Testing
Unit and integration tests should be written to ensure the reliability of the application. Jest or Mocha/Chai can be used for this purpose.
```
To run test: yarn test
```
***Note: Testing setup is not included in the provided code. You may need to integrate a testing framework.***

## Deployment
For deploying this application, consider the following steps:
## Production Environment Setup
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment variables.
- Ensure MongoDB is securely connected and accessible.

## Using a Process Manager

- Use `PM2` or a similar process manager to ensure that the application remains online and restarts if it crashes.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Integrate with services like Winston, Graylog, or Logstash for advanced logging.
- Use New Relic, Datadog, or similar tools for performance monitoring.

## Security Considerations
- Use SSL/TLS for secure communication.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Future Improvements
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement JWT or OAuth for user authentication and authorization.

- **Enhanced Caching:** Introduce Redis for distributed caching in a multi-server environment.

- **Automated Testing:** Integrate a full testing suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

- **API Documentation:** Add API documentation using Swagger or similar tools.
